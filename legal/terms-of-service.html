        <li>The accuracy, reliability, or availability of third-party content</li>
        <li>Any changes or removal of third-party content</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Damages resulting from content you save or access through the App</li>
        <li>Damages resulting from unauthorized access to your device or data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
